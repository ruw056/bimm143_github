## Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular. 

The core steps to using git involve

1. Initiate a git repository 
    In RStudio we just click a little radio button on project creation 
    At the command line we type:
    `git init`
    
2. Do your normal work
    Add files
    Modify files etc.

3. Add your important files to the "stage" 
    In RStudio we click "staged" radio button
    `git add yourfilename`

4. Commit your staged files to the repository 
    In RStudio you just hit the "Commit" button and add a msg
    `git commit -m "your wee msg"`
    
    
    
You can check your project "history" and status
    `git status`
    `git log` (push q to exit)
